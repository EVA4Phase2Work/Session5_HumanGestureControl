# Vedio Pause/Start based on the movement of the Hands.

#### The Human Gesture control is about handling the human gesture  and take decisions based on the Human Gesture

#### The Project is about controlling the Play and Stop of a Vedio based on the  movement of the hand.

#####  handtrack/demo/index.html --> On clicking Index.html a html page opens which contains the vedio to be paused  as well as the facility to enable vedio from the PC-Web cam.

##### The Web-Cam will capture the hand movement and based on the hand movement it will either start or pause a vedio.

##### The logic of hand movement is available at handtrack/demo/js/index.js
